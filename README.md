The Zawjen al-Tawheed project aims to reconnect people with nature and promote the message of Tawheed (monotheism) through a digital platform. It plans to provide accessible content in multiple languages, focusing on differentiating truth from falsehood using verified and categorized information (green, red, yellow). The initiative emphasizes open-source collaboration, welcoming contributions from developers, scholars, translators, and more. The platform will eventually expand to include diverse content and create a global, scholarly environment for knowledge seekers.

For a detailed UX design document based on this mission, hereâ€™s a suggested structure:
